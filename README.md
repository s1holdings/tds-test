ClearShield™ 3 Mil Luster UV Standard Low Melt Laminating Film is a clear polyester film with a pleasing, lustrous finish. It provides an economical way to protect maps, photos, drawings, posters, presentations and other prints that will be handled frequently or displayed in rooms where they might be exposed to sunlight, fluorescent lights, water, airborne chemicals or cleaning solvents.

The strong, low-melt adhesive bonds well to a variety of prints, including inkjet prints on bond papers or inkjet photo papers with microporous coatings. This film is also good for protecting photographs processed through photo imagers such as the Durst Lambda, Lightjet or Chromira or graphics printed on electrographic (toner-based) printers.

The film itself provides a high level of protection from abrasion, water, and exposure to oil, acids, and cleaning solutions. UV inhibitors in the adhesive protect the film and underlying graphics from the damaging effects of exposure to sunlight and fluorescent lights.

The film is called "low-melt" because it is backed by a heat-activated (thermal) adhesive that softens and starts bonding to the print at lower temperatures than conventional thermal laminating films.

KSP - Protects prints from abrasion, water and exposure to common chemicals.
KSP - Ideal for laminating inkjet prints on bond or microporous papers or conventional photo prints.
KSP - 3-mil, clear polyester laminating film with a low-melt adhesive and a lustrous finish.
